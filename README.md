# Personal-Assitant
This is a plug and play Personal assistant
I have made the personal assitant plug and play all you have to do is get a [Wolframapha API] Key then past it into the marked spots in [calculator_run.py], and in [seatch_run.py]. You will also need to download the needed imports from [all_imports.txt]


After you do these steps it should run. If not please report the issue as i will be upgrading and updating the Personal Assistant
